### 🔧 What I Do Best  
- Build **backend systems and full-stack applications** using Java, JavaScript, and MySQL.
- Ship user-facing apps end-to-end — I built **Snug**, a full-stack web app to help users find study spots and cafés, from user auth through deployment.

### What Drives Me  
I love building things that challenge me to think how I design the system and optimize performance. I also enjoy creating intuitive interfaces until I impulsively decide to restart everything because I looked at my design a bit too long. Most of all, I enjoy collaborating with others who are passionate, decisive, and motivated.
